# Parse Measurements

Implement a function named `parse_measurements` that takes one list-like parameter containing a list of strings representing measurements and passes each string "parse_measurement" function defined above. These measurement tuple values should be added to a list and the list should be returned.

* For example, calling this function with an argument of `["2 ft", "5 ft", "8.5 meters"]` should return a list object that resembles: `[(2, "ft"), (5, "ft"), (8.5, "meters")]`
